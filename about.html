    <h1>About Link Sanitizer</h1>

    <p>
      Link Sanitizer helps you clean up those long, messy links you find online.
      Many websites add extra bits of information to links, called "tracking parameters,"
      that follow you around the internet. This extension removes those extra bits,
      giving you a cleaner, more private link.
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
      When you paste a link into the extension, it looks for common tracking parameters
      like <code>utm_source</code>, <code>fbclid</code>, and others. It then removes these parameters,
      leaving you with just the main part of the link.
    </p>

    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      This extension does not collect any of your personal data. The links you sanitize
      are processed locally on your computer and are not sent to any external servers,
      except when using the shortener function, which uses a third party service. Your information is safe.
    </p>
